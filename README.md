With the covid period shunning us to our homes, schools and colleges have resorted 
to online modes of teaching. But most of them have not yet updated the record maintenance 
system to online mode. This creates ambiguity and clash of data records between the 
students and faculties. The project herein displays a unanimous database management 
system with an interactive interface for both administrations and students. This creates a 
level of transparency between faculties and students regarding their attendance and grades, 
thereby eliminating any confusion and facilitating easy access of student data.
